        <h1>DOOM</h1>
            <p><b>Doom</b> is a <em>first-person shooter</em> made in 1993 and since then has a <small>cult-following</small> with many sequels including 
            <i>Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994), Doom Eternal (2020) and Doom: The Dark Ages (2025)</i> just to name a few.

        <h2>What is it about?</h2>
            <p>The story follows the journey of a space marine (unofficially referred to as doomguy) who fights through hordes 
                of undead humans and demons. The game begins on the moons of Mars and finishes in hell, all while traversing 
                each level to find the exit or defeat the final boss. When I say hordes, I mean there is literally no break in between
                cut-scenes of enemies! 
            <br><br> Here's the most annoying demons from <i>Doom Eternal</i>: <br> - Cacodemon <br>- Atachnotron <br>- Imp <br>- Mancubus
            </p>
        <h2>Is the Music Epic?</h2>
            <p> YES! If you don't know who <mark>Mick Gordon</mark> is then you're really missing out (espesically if you are a metal-head). He 
                was the sole composer of the <i>Doom remake (2016)</i> and also composed a significant portion of <i>Doom Eternal</i>, which included
                the song we all know <b>"The Only Thing They Fear Is You"</b>. That's the action song in all of the fighting memes with the epic 
                drop. Just look up "<u>The only thin they fear is you compilation</u>" in Google and you wont be dissapointed.

        <h2>Should I Play The Game?</h2>
        <p>
            If you like fast-paced FPS games like Call of Duty and Halo then, yes! If you don't like anxiety then, no. It's 
            basically like COD Zombies, but the demons have their own abilities and some are massive, so if you get scared
            easily then maybe <del>The Sims is a better game</del> give this one a miss.
