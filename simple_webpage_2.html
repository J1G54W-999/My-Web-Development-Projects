            <h2>Red Team: Offensive</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Role:</b> The Red Team consists of penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security professionals who simulate attacks on systems to identify vulnerabilities.<br><br>
                    <b>Objective:</b> Their primary goal is to find and exploit weaknesses in security before malicious actors can do so. They conduct controlled attacks to assess the effectiveness of security protocols and provide insights for improvement.

            <h2>Blue Team: Defensive</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Role:</b> The Blue Team is responsible for defending an organisationâ€™s systems against cyber attacks. They monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents, making them a highly valuable asset to the organisation.<br><br>
                    <b>Objective:</b> Their main focus is to protect the organisation from breaches, mitigate damage during an attack, and ensure that security measures are in place and functioning effectively. They analyse alerts, investigate incidents, and implement security policies.

                <p>
                    <b>Role:</b> The Purple Team bridges the gap between the Red and Blue Teams, facilitating communication and collaboration between offensive and defensive security efforts.<br><br>
                    <b>Objective:</b> Their aim is to enhance the overall security posture of the organisation by sharing insights and strategies from both teams. They work to ensure that the findings from penetration tests are effectively integrated into defensive strategies, creating a more robust security framework.
